# Song for Jane â€” Personal Songwriting with AI

**Song for Jane** is a DIY AI songwriting tool that helps you write lyrics and generate chord progressions tailored to your unique voice, taste, and emotional world.

This project is part of the **Make It Personal** ( https://makeitpesonal.substack.com/ ) initiative â€” exploring how AI can be expressive, accessible, and human-centered.

### Personalised Memory-Assisted Prompting

Memory-Assisted Prompting works by turning past user preferences into active context for future generations.

Every time the user keeps an output (a line, a metaphor, a verse), or rejects it with feedback, that choice is stored in memory. The next time a prompt is submitted, the system includes a short summary of those past preferences â€” allowing the language model to respond with content that aligns more closely with the userâ€™s voice, style, and emotional direction.

### Available Modes:

- Simple Mode â€“ Generate a single output using memory â€” including both liked and (optionally) rejected lines. Keep or reject with feedback.

- Loop Mode â€“ Generate multiple outputs at once. Select what resonates, reject what doesnâ€™t, and leave comments to guide Janeâ€™s voice.

- Chain Mode â€“ Chain of Thoughts. Iterative ideation on a chosen topic. Step by step generation.
