    """
    Placeholder for PEFT/Unsloth LoRA training integration.

    Args:
        texts: mapping of labeled texts (e.g., {"positive": "...", "neutral": "...", "negative": "..."})
               or any schema you define for style adaptation.

    Returns:
        adapter_version_id (str) if a new adapter was produced, otherwise None.

    Implementation notes (future):
    - Build a small dataset from MemoryStore (user-approved rewrites, liked outputs).
    - Tokenize and fine-tune with PEFT/Unsloth (LoRA) on top of your base LLM.
    - Save adapter under models/adapters/{user_id}/v{N} and register in config.
