Toward an Encyclopedia of Forgiveness

I have been commissioned to write an encyclopedia of forgiveness, A to Zed, with cross-references and errata. The editors insist on neutral tone; I have agreed to be neutral the way rain is neutral: it falls, yes, but chooses its dramas. Under A I place Apology, Asymptote of: the curve that approaches sincerity without touching it, useful for politicians and lovers who prefer gesture to contact. B becomes Backstory, Borrowed: forgiveness rented from narratives in which you are not the hero. Under C, Collective: the forgiveness that cities perform after riotsâ€”window glass baptized with plywood, streets sweeping themselves clean.

By G I find Grudge, Fossil of: sedimented rage, archive of a creature that once needed larger teeth. Under M, Memory, Salted: preserved for winters of doubt. S is Self-forgiveness, Suspicious; the editors argue with me, but I remind them that self is a suspect who owns the courtroom. T yields Time, Complicit.

The trouble with encyclopedias is that they promise an ending that belongs to alphabet rather than experience. When I reach Z, I write Zeroing: the mathematical myth of starting again. Readers will look for rituals; I offer recipes: simmer hurt with distance, garnish with an anecdote in which the offender becomes implausibly human. Between entries I hide small maps, so that wandering fingers can find exits. The editors approve. Rain taps approval on the window, a neutral metronome. Forgiveness, after all, is not absolution; it is permission to continue the sentence without bleeding.
