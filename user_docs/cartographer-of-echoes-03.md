Cartographer of Echoes

I map echoes for a living. Don’t laugh. The world is not made of matter or meaning but of reverberations pretending to be both. You can tell where a cathedral has been demolished by the way pigeons sound slightly guilty above empty lots. You can tell where a promise broke by the chime that refuses to die in the listener’s ear, becoming tinnitus branded with the speaker’s initials.

Customers hire me to locate lost statements. One woman asked for the exact coordinates of a yes that never arrived; she swore it must be trapped in the ventilation of a train that left without her. I found it not in the ducts but in the station clock, whose minute hand dragged as if wading through honey—time itself sticky with aborted affirmations. A man begged me to retrieve his father’s laugh. It had lodged in a theater seat after the final show; every night the empty cushion shook, faithful as a dog, to the ghost of a joke no one could retell.

My instruments are humble: a cracked glass, a notebook that only absorbs sounds written sideways, a pair of shoes that squeak in B minor. I listen until the world blushes. The map grows. In the margins I sketch small legends: Here be murmurs that thought themselves roars. There, roars that envied murmurs their privacy. When I sleep, the echoes dream me back into their mouths. Morning arrives—an exhale with cartographic ambitions. I lace my shoes and go measure the distance between what we say and what we keep.
