# Prosody Corpus (KB)

This folder stores **source texts about versification and craft** that the retriever turns into an evidence pack (rules, checklists, examples). Keep it **concise, quotable, and licensable**.

## What to put here
- **Theory & guides**: meter/rhythm (iambic/trochaic), rhyme schemes, stanza shapes, enjambment, sound devices.
- **Craft notes**: editing checklists, cliché lists, line surgery tips, metaphor discovery methods.
- **Slide decks / talk notes**: bullet-point rules and examples.
- **Curated examples**: short excerpts (2–10 lines) that illustrate a rule (with source).
- **Glossaries**: scansion exceptions, rhyme families, sonic devices.

## What **not** to put
- Full copyrighted books/articles **without permission**.
- Raw lyrics/poems you don’t have rights to.
- Personal data or private docs.

## Formats accepted
- `.md`, `.txt` (best)
- `.pdf` (optional; if used, also add a `.md` summary for reliable chunking)
