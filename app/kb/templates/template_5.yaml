label: Metaphor Discovery — Object Ladder & Domain Mapping
language: en
guidance:
  method:
    - "Object Ladder: pick a scene object → list 10 sensory attributes → promote 1–2 to governing metaphors."
    - "Domain Mapping: map scene domain (transit) to emotion domain (departure/regret)."
    - "Constraint: keep transport-domain nouns; avoid mixing domains in same stanza."
  prompts:
    - "List 10 physical attributes of the object (texture, temperature, motion)."
    - "Ask: how does this object behave like the feeling?"
  failure_modes:
    - "Dead metaphors ('broken heart', 'cold as ice')."
    - "Mixed metaphors in one stanza."
